# Density-window selection from failure of (P+)

This module records a boundary-only density-window lemma: from failure of the
boundary wedge `(P+)` for a boundary trace `u = boundaryRe F`, one can select a
negative level and a short symmetric interval on which the negative sublevel set
occupies nearly full relative measure. This is the quantitative window used in
the wedge contradiction.

It is independent of Poisson smoothing; pairing with Egorov/AI is handled
elsewhere.

/-- Density-window from failure of `(P+)` for the boundary trace of `F`.

Let `u(t) := boundaryRe F t`. If `(P+)` fails for `F` on the boundary, then for
every `ε ∈ (0,1)` there exist a margin `κ>0`, a center `t0`, and a half-length
`L>0` with `|I|=2L ≤ 1` such that the negative sublevel set
`{t | u(t) ≤ -2κ}` occupies at least `(1-ε/2)` of the interval `I=[t0−L,t0+L]`.
