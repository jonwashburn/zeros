# Pinch route: unconditional removable existence and zero-arg RH entry

This module constructs the CR/pinch removable local data at ξ_ext-zeros
for `Θ := Θ_pinch_of det2 O`, using the simple choice `u := 1 / F_pinch`
with `F_pinch = 2 · J_pinch`.

Non-invasive: adds only a new file. Existing modules are unchanged.

/-- Local removable existence at ξ_ext-zeros for the pinch Θ.

Given the standard `Det2OnOmega` and an outer from
`OuterHalfPlane.ofModulus_det2_over_xi_ext`, we produce, for each
`ρ ∈ Ω` with `riemannXi_ext ρ = 0`, an isolating open `U ⊆ Ω` and a
holomorphic extension `g` with `EqOn (Θ_pinch_of det2 O) g (U \ {ρ})`
and `g ρ = 1`, together with a nontriviality witness.

Mathematically: with `F := 2·J_pinch` we take `u := 1/F`. Near a ξ-zero
the denominator `O·ξ_ext` has a zero while `det2` stays nonzero, so
`J_pinch → ∞` and thus `u → 0`. Since `Θ = (1 - u)/(1 + u)` on
`U \ {ρ}`, the pinned-update lemma gives a removable extension with value 1.
